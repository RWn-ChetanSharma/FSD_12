    <h1>Variables In JS</h1>
    <p>
      Variables are containers for storing information. Creating a variable in
      JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable: var carName; After the
      declaration, the variable is empty (it has no value).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Variable names must start with a letter, an underscore ( _ ) or a dollar
        sign ( $ ).
      </li>

      <li>Variable names cannot contain spaces.</li>

      <li>
        Variables cannot be the same as reserved keywords such as if or const.
      </li>
      <li>
        By convention, JavaScript variable names are written in camelCase.
      </li>
    </ul>

      // Variables In JS

      // We have Three types of Variables

      // 1. Var

      // =>  It was used before ES6

      var a = 10; // Initialization and Declaration
      var a = 20; // Re-declaration is possible
      a = 30; // Re-assignment is possible
      console.log(a);

      // 2. let

      let name = "Harpal"; // Initialization and Declaration
      // let name = "Harpal Patel";     // Re-declaration is not possible
      name = "Harpal Khachar"; // Re-assignment is possible
      console.log(name);

      // 3. const

      const favActress = "Anushka"; // Initialization and Declaration
      const fav_actress = "Alia";   // Re-declaration is not possible
      fav_actress = "Deepika";       // Re-assignment is not possible
      console.log(fav_actress);
